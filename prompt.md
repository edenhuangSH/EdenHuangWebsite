# Prompt 2

Polish the website with all of these details:

Basic bio:
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/eden-huang/
- This is the company website: 
- This is the pre-A round deck: data/pre-A轮投资方案.pdf (make sure no clear business propriety information is leaked). 

Additionally, below is a Cursor-ready structured file you can drop into your repo as:
- /data/content/bio.md
- /data/content/profile.json
- /data/content/site-config.md

This is written so your AI tools can understand your positioning clearly.

- New for Tech:

You can also mention that I enjoy vibe-coding. In particular, I like to develop utilities tools for my own startup, and create valuable products for friends to use on a daily basis. For example, this AI Research Assistant can be my first featured tool: /Users/edenhuangsh/Documents/dev-projects/others/hpv-detection(Github: https://github.com/edenhuangSH/personal-research-assistant). 

First polish the Tech sector with my hobbies and then put the AI Research Assistant as the first capstone project.

# Prompt 3

- Research and Stories:

Raw content are all in the folder: data/content/articles. Now going through all these articles holistically and then individually, decide what content should fall under Research and what on Stories. Modify the format of the content accordingly to match the overall design of the website. If audio or video, then embed it on the website.
