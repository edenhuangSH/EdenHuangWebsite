1️⃣ Long-Form Bio (Founder's Version)
Eden Huang
Eden Huang is a global MedTech founder, operator, and AI-native product builder working at the intersection of neuromodulation, digital health, and cross-border innovation.
He is the Co-Founder & COO of Innostim MedTech (未电科技), a Beijing- and Hong Kong-based medical device company focused on non-invasive neuromodulation for Overactive Bladder (OAB) and related pelvic health conditions. The company operates across China, the U.S., and Australia in collaboration with Australis Scientific, advancing regulatory approvals, localized manufacturing, and AI-enhanced therapeutic systems.
Eden is based between Boston (Harvard Life Lab), Beijing, and Hong Kong, helping bridge clinical science, product strategy, manufacturing, and global commercialization.
His work centers on three core themes:
•	Non-invasive neuromodulation as a platform technology
•	AI-native startup workflows
•	Global capital & cross-border systems design
 
Background
•	Data Science / AI Product background
•	Educated in the U.S. (University of Minnesota; Duke University)
•	2012–present: U.S. & China cross-border work
•	Experience spanning healthcare, AI systems, regulatory strategy, and venture building
 
What I Work On
1. MedTech & Neuromodulation
•	OAB and pelvic health neuromodulation
•	Clinical pathway design (China NMPA, U.S. regulatory strategy)
•	TTNS / PTNS device localization
•	Manufacturing & compliance systems
•	AI-enhanced therapy protocols
2. AI-Native Startup Systems
•	Designing AI-augmented workflows
•	AI as strategic leverage, not chatbot novelty
•	Structured decision frameworks for founders
•	Product-driven regulatory scaling
3. Capital & Systems Thinking
•	Global asset allocation
•	Cross-border entity design (U.S./China/HK)
•	Founder equity strategy
•	Real estate & long-term macro positioning
 
Philosophy
I believe:
•	Most innovation fails not because of technology, but because of regulatory, operational, and structural blind spots.
•	AI is not a tool — it is a workflow redesign event.
•	Geography is optional. Systems thinking is not.
•	Long-term positioning beats short-term optimization.
•	Health technology should move from invasive and reactive to non-invasive and preventative.
 
Current Focus (2026)
•	Scaling Innostim MedTech’s clinical & commercialization roadmap
•	Expanding non-invasive neuromodulation indications
•	Designing AI-native operational infrastructure
•	Building long-term cross-border capital structure
